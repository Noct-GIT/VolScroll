# VolScroll
Use mousewheel to change app volume by hovering over titlebar and scrolling up or down.


# App Volume Control

A lightweight Windows utility that lets you control the volume of any application just by hovering your mouse over its title bar and scrolling.

> **SCREENSHOT:** This is where I would share a screenshot of it working for you. But this app has no gui. It is completely invisible except for the taskbar icon. Don't forget its there!

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Hover to Control:** Adjust the volume of **any window** by simply hovering your mouse over its top ~40 pixels and scrolling your mouse wheel.
*   **Works on Unfocused Windows:** Change the volume of background applications without needing to click on them first.
*   **System Tray Integration:** Runs silently in your system tray (the area by the clock) and uses minimal resources.
*   **Start with Windows:** A simple right-click option to enable or disable the app from launching automatically when you log in.
*   **Lightweight & Portable:** The entire application is a single `.exe` file that requires no installation.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Getting started is easy. No installer is required.

1.  **Download:** Download the .zip file from the Releases section of GitHub (usually on the right side) click on 1.0 and download the .zip file.
2.  **Extract the folder and place it wherever you want it.
3.  **Run the App:** Double-click the `.exe` to start it. You will see its icon appear in your system tray. If you have difficulty getting it working on some apps you may want to run it as Administrator.
4.  **Enable Startup (Recommended):** Right-click the new tray icon and select **"Start with Windows"**. This will ensure the app runs automatically every time you turn on your computer.

## üñ±Ô∏è How to Use

The application has two primary functions:

*   **To Change Volume:**
    1.  Move your mouse cursor so it is **hovering** over the title bar (the very top part) of any application window.
    2.  **Scroll your mouse wheel** up to increase the volume of that specific app, or scroll down to decrease it.

*   **To Access Options:**
    1.  **Right-click** the application's icon in the system tray.
    2.  From the menu, you can enable/disable starting with Windows, go to the support page, or exit the application.
